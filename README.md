My essay can be divided into three parts. For the first past, I collected and cleaned the stock information, constructed features that are used in original formula -ROC and EY - and successfully verified the validity of original formula in Chinese Market. In the second part, by plotting historical trend of market index via line chart, I found best holding period (1.5 years) and purchasing time (1 and 3 quarter). Finally, I selected 12 common financial features, constructed multiple regression models with average earning of the stock and retained 3 most valuable factors - AVGROE, AVGROA and PEG - to construct new strategy for investors.
